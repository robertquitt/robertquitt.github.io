## Me

I'm Robert. As of December 2020, I work as a software engineer.

## My Projects

I'm currently working on [RoboSub][robosub], a competition to build and program an autonomous underwater vehicle.

I've worked on various sysadmin projects with [CSUA][csua] and [UC Berkeley IEEE][ieee].

## My Software Tools

I think that the only way to do your job right is to have the right tools.

When I work on systems administation, I spend a lot of time `ssh`'d into remote boxes. On the terminal, I like to use the following tools:

- [Vim][vim] for editing text effectively
- [Tmux][tmux] for session persistence and pane splitting
* [Mosh][mosh] for keeping ssh sessions open and stable in spite of dodgy connections

To sync and track my configurations across machines, I store my [dotfiles here][dotfiles].

My primary programming language is Python. The standard library is so rich it brings a tear to my eye.

## My Blog

I'd like to share my experiences working with software, hopefully to assist people who are doing the same things as I am. I'd also like to share my workflow and problem-solving process. I'd also like to get better at writing and publishing. Thanks for visiting!
