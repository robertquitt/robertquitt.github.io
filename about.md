## Me

I'm Robert, a sophomore studying computer science at UC Berkeley. As of March
2018, I am involved with technical work with a few student orgs ([CSUA][csua],
[IEEE][ieee]) working on a [research project][ucb-hls] in the architecture lab
here. I am currently taking [CS152][cs152] (Computer Architecture and
Engineering) and [EE123][ee123] (Digital Signal Processing).

I've worked on [RoboSub][robosub], which was a very fulfilling team project.

## My Jobs

This Summer (Summer 2018), I'll be working at Facebook as a Software
Engineering Intern. I've also worked as a Software Engineering Intern at
Qualcomm. My time at Qualcomm was very fruitful, and I would recommend anyone
who gets the chance to work there to take it. (Not to mention the great San
Diego burritos!)

## My Machines

As for machines I own, I primarily use a Surface book running Win10 when I'm
out and about.  At home, I use an Asus laptop-turned-dekstop running Win10. I
have two servers at home as well, both running Ubuntu 16.04. I primarily use
these machines for development.

On Windows, I tend to use Git Bash on MinTTY and ssh to access my remote
machines. I usually never use the Ubuntu desktop.

## My Software Tools

On the terminal, I use the following tools:

- [Vim][vim]
- [Tmux][tmux]
- [Ranger][ranger]

You can find my [dotfiles here][dotfiles].

My primary programming language is Python.

## This Blog

I'd like to share my experiences working with various pieces of software,
hopefully to assist people who are doing the same things as I am. I'd also like
to share my workflow and problem-solving process.
