## Me

I'm Robert, a rising junior studying computer science at UC Berkeley. As of June
2018, I am currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at Facebook in Menlo Park.

## My Projects

I'm currently working on [RoboSub][robosub], a competition to build and program an autonomous underwater vehicle.

I've worked on various sysadmin projects with [CSUA][csua] and [UC Berkeley IEEE].

## My Machines

I have been interested in computers as long as I can remember. Here are machines that I personally own (not pwned), for my own and others' reference.

- Robert-PC
  - Notebook: Acer Aspire (?)
  - Processor: Intel Core Duo
  - OS: Windows Vista
  - Notes: A prize for winning a math contest in May 2009, this laptop was used to programmed many robots throughout middle school. As one of its final missions, it simulated the Bishop cannon, launching Kerbonaut Jeb Kerman into the lower statosphere. 
- duck (fmr. Robert2-PC)
  - Notebook: Acer Aspire E1-571
  - Processor: Intel i5-3210M
  - OS: Ubuntu 16.04 GNU/Linux Headless
  - Story: This laptop was purchased new in Nov 2013, and used for robotics, cybersecurity, and APCS. The main hinge failed sometime around 2014, but was held together by electrical and duct tape for many months. I wrote the story of Robert2-PC for my college admissions essay. Robert2-PC was rechristened into Ubuntu GNU/Linux as duck in Aug 2016, and lived under my bed in Foothill student housing for a year. duck now lives in my closet.
- falcon/goose (fmr. Robert3-PC)
  - Notebook: Asus X550JX 
  - Processor: Intel i7-4720HQ
  - OS: Ubuntu 18.04 GNU/Linux / Windows 10
  - Story: Purchased new in Nov 2015, this powerful laptop replaced Robert2-PC. Unlike its predecessors, it is capable of performing more intense tasks such as video recording and editing, and some PC gaming. Motherboard was RMA'd for faulty graphics and system instability in Nov 2016. Upon return, rechristened into Ubuntu GNU/Linux as falcon. falcon's battery died during Robosub in July 2017, and was converted into a faux-desktop dual-booting Windows 10 machine called goose. Moved to my apartment in Aug 2017 and lived stationary on my desk until the completion of hawk in June 2018. goose was freed from its role as a desktop and seeks new horizons as an Ubuntu GNU/Linux laptop, awaiting a replacement battery.
- eagle (fmr. Robert4-PC)
  - Notebook: Microsoft Surface Book
  - Processor: Intel i5-6300U
  - OS: Windows 10
  - Story: I bought this laptop new in Nov 2016 as a replacement for my faulty Robert3-PC. Lighter, more portable, and with incredible battery life, Robert4-PC turned heads as it made its way through lectures, labs, hackathons, and more. With the return of Robert3-PC as falcon, Robert4-PC became eagle. eagle is still used today as my handy travel computer.
- hawk
  - Case: DIYPC-D480-DK
  - Motherboard: [Super Micro X8DTi-F][x8dti]
  - Processor: 2x Intel Xeon X5660
  - Story: What started as a $100 motherboard grab in from Berkeley's Free & For Sale group in March 2018 turned into my first desktop box. The motherboard had 2 Xeons, 48GB of RAM, and two fans already installed. I bought a case, power supply, and hard drive, assembled it and installed Ubuntu 16.04. I attempted to install a graphics card, but was having trouble getting it to be powered properly (you mean the second power connector *isn't* optional?) Realizing that it would probably consume more than the 2 weekends I already spent on it, hawk was shelved as a beefy dev server until June 2018, when I installed the graphics card, and Windows 10. I haven't yet decided on a name for the Windows persona hostname.

## My Software Tools

I think that the only way to do your job right is to have the right tools.

When I work on systems administation, I spend a lot of time `ssh`'d into remote boxes. On the terminal, I like to use the following tools:

- [Vim][vim] for editing text effectively
- [Tmux][tmux] for session persistence and pane splitting
- [Ranger][ranger] for navigating filesystems effectively

To sync and track my configurations across machines, I store my [dotfiles here][dotfiles].

My primary programming language is Python. The standard library is so rich it brings a tear to my eye.

## My Blog

I'd like to share my experiences working with software, hopefully to assist people who are doing the same things as I am. I'd also like to share my workflow and problem-solving process. I'd also like to get better at writing and publishing. Thanks for visiting!
