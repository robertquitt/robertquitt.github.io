I like programming as both a hobby and career. I like to using programming to help solve problems, whether for practicality or for amusement. In other words, these are hacks.

Here's a list of some of the projects that I've made or worked on. This is by no means comprehensive. This is mostly for my own reference so I can find the links later when I want to show someone something I went and did. Maybe someday when I'm seeking employment again I'll make it look nice.
