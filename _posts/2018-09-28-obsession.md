**Rambling about Obsession over Computers**

I've often found myself mindlessly scrolling through [hacker news][1], looking for new articles about the latest tech-related news. I frequently browse [/g/][2], reading anonymous comments about various topics related to computers. I chat with buddies about programming languages, software and hardware. We talk about the latest tech news. It seems like much of what I consider "personal time" is spent on computers. Over the past summer, I programmed a lot in my spare time. Even though I went to work for about 8 hours, I came back home and worked on programming. I read through a [book on FreeBSD][3]. I assembled a computer.

Computers are a hobby of mine. This isn't even mentioning the amount of time I spend doing assignments and research. I often wonder, what about the people who aren't like me? What about people who just work on computers as a job? What about having a hobby that doesn't have to do with your job?

I know a few people who study computer science and wouldn't consider computer science a personal hobby. It seems like they generally adopt the mindset that CS is a skill for a job, and don't think too much beyond it. But, when I think about how recruiters find new talent for CS jobs, I think they tend to look for experience doing hackathons and/or personal projects. On Piazza careers, there is a field you can enter that says how long you have been programming for. This presents a problem. Should it be expected that people studying CS should also devote their lives to it? What about getting recruited to the "top" companies? Isn't it unfair for people who don't want to dedicate much of their life into learning computer programmming?

Throughout my high school life, I thought of computer programming as only a hobby. I didn't consider it as a career option. Well, I didn't think about career options at all. There were many engineers in my robotics team, but I didn't actually know what they did. It wasn't until I was offered an internship late in my senior year that I learned what engineers do. I didn't realize that all the computer programming I was doing for fun was very useful for a career. My teachers, mentors, parents, all saw that it was something valuable, and encouraged me to study it in college.

After working as a software engineering interning a few times and starting college, I realized two things. First, I would have to make a living, and second, computer programming pays well. I now consider myself extremely lucky. I have the privelege of having one of my hobbies be the same as my career. I need to remind myself of this often when I work with people, as not everyone in my major has been programming for as long as I have and may not understand the same way I do. The amount of experience I have, ironically, is the source of some doubt. I think, "what if I'm not actually that smart and just have been doing well because I've been programming for a long time? Is this what explains why my grades are consistently worse in EE courses? Will I be replaced by some up-and-coming computer genius kid when I'm older because I don't stay up to date?" These doubts don't worry me much now, but what about when I get older and want to do things that aren't computer programming?

I want to have a life. I want to have a family. I want to pursure my many ambitions have been set aside by my obsession with computers. Lately I've been trying to balance that more. I've realized that my relationships matter more than computers ever will. I want to make people laugh and feel loved. I want to counteract the problems in society exacerbated by the very technology that I enjoy working on so much.

I will continue to work on computers, most likely. If I don't get to, then that's ok. It's ok because there is a hidden cost to wanting to do well in computer science. It's that you can always train to get better at home. At my core, I know that for a lot of things, I want to do my best. For computer programming, this can become a problem.

There is a pretty large distinction between recreational and vocational programming. Programming for fun is more about trying new things, doing interesting, creative, self guided projects. Programming for work is a lot of reading other people's code, communication, reasoning about a system, writing simple code. I can program recreationally and not really get tired. One of the things that keeps me up working at night is voraciously working on recreational code. There is no way I would have the same level of energy for code that I write at work. Programming recreationally is one of the things that keeps it interesting. If I didn't balance recreational and vocational programming, I would probably get pretty bored of the vocational programming.

It is very easy for me to fall into a trap of recreational programming day-in and day-out. The issue with this is I want to grow in ways that aren't just learning more about programming. I have a long career ahead of me where I can do that. It's just so hard not to, knowing that my programming performance could be improved, and given the already high amount of enjoyment I get from programming. It just feels wrong to do sometimes. I'm still very conflicted about this.

The irony of computer programming is that to be good at solving problems, you have to be persistent, to the point of obsession. If you've spent a lot of time unblocking yourself over a problem and you'll know what I mean. However, it's dubious to say that obsessing over real life problems is good. On one hand obsessing is what gets us to solve the hardest problems. It's what makes engineers, mathematicians and the like think about solutions and weigh options, and this ability to apply logic and preservere is one that is valued in those disciplines. Take, for example, this quote from the article [*Dealing with Hard Problems*][4].

> Brilliant "Aha!" moments almost always spring from minds cultivated by long periods of frustration. But without that frustration, those brilliant ideas never arise.

As good as it is to make brilliant discoveries, this mode of thinking should only be applied to hard problems.

I made the mistake of applying this logical thinking to real life scenarios, particularly from a psychology perspective. I tried learning psychology as if it was an encompassing explanation for all human behavior. I tried to reason out why people acted a particular way. Oh, how wrong I was.

The more I think about it, the stranger I realize life is. So, the obvious solution is to not think about it so much. My dad said "don't ask so many questions". That was some of the best advice I ever got. Leave asking hard questions to answering hard problems. When it comes to people, don't overthink it. In fact, don't think about it much at all. Things get much simpler that way.

Thanks for reading, as always! :)

P.S.  
I wanted to talk about obsession over problems but ended up going a bit off-topic. Things I wanted to elaborate on: hobbies/job and identity, money and hobbies, balancing logical and non-logical thought. This post is already pretty long so they will end up being seperate.
