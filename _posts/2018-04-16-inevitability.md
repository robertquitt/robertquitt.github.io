**Why Tech in CS Orgs is Bound to Continually Fail, and How to Fix That**

I've been working with the tech stacks for UC Berkeley IEEE and UC
Berkeley CSUA for a while now, and something I've been thinking about is
the inevitable failure of the technology in these organizations. Don't
take this the wrong way, there are great, smart people working in these
clubs. There are people who I really respect and admire who work on
server administration tasks. We care about the continued operation and
success of our organizations.

The problem is that, *every 4 years, no one is around anymore*. Let me
repeat that: no one who initially set up a piece of technology 4 years
ago is around to maintain, develop, debug, etc.

We rely on our own time and ingenuity to understand the intentions of the
original workers. The main problem is a lack of documentation and
information for maintainers. This leads to headaches and digging through
configs, trying to understand design decisions and oftentimes convoluted
configuration.

For example, often, the sequence of commands used to fix a problem in a
system is used over and over. Most of the time, this is transferred by
word-of-mouth or through instant messaging (FB messenger, Slack, etc.)

Another example is instructions on how to set something up. This is a
problem for two reasons. Firstly, it makes it harder to rebuild if it
breaks completely or gets wiped. Secondly, it makes it harder for the
next generation of maintaners to work on.
